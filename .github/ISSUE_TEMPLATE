To make sure your feature request or bug report is properly handled, follow the guidelines below.

### Reporting a bug

When reporting a bug, make sure to include your setup:
* operating system (Windows/OSX/Linux)
* if website: browser used (name and version if possible)
* if offline application: application version

If possible try to include exact steps to reproduce (STRs) that can be used by anyone else to reproduce the bug.

When reporting a __crash__ or a __performance issue__ please also include:
* the number of frames of the sprite
* the resolution of the sprite
* the estimated session duration

### Feature or enhancement request

These don't necessarily need to be as detailed as bug reports, but the more detailed they are, the easier it will be to get started.

If the feature request is inspired by a feature from another software, a few screenshots or a GIF are great to illustrate the request.
