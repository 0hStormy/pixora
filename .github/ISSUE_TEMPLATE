### Reporting a bug

As much as possible, a bug report should include:
* exact steps to reproduce (STRs)
* screenshot of the application after the bug
* setup details:
  * operating system
  * browser used
  * (or if offline application: application version)
* for crashes / performance issues also include:
  * number of frames
  * sprite resolution
  * session duration

Feel free to include a .piskel file of the sprite where you faced the bug if it can help to reproduce the problem.

### Feature or enhancement request

Great ways to illustrate feature requests are for instance:
* mock ups
* screenshots / GIF (from another sof)
* step by step flow
