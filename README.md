Trying to wake up after a big 8 months nap.

Also, new features :
* color picker : ![color picker](http://screenletstore.appspot.com/img/18e24a63-c8a4-11e2-b479-13a291e88f09.png)
* create an animated GIF from your piskel (uses jsgif, results may vary ...)

Just a quick update to post a new screenshot. @grosbouddha is delivering features so fast, it's hard to keep up !

15 Sep 2012
------------------------------------
2 weeks already since the last README.md update, and so many changes ! There has been a continuous stream of features added to piskel by @grosboudda, @captainbrosset (thanks guys) and myself.
I can't list everything here but quickly
* __Tools__ : in addition to the regular Pen, you can now draw Rectangles, Circles. You can move stuff, copy, paste !
* __Undo/redo__ : you can now cancel your actions using ctrl-z/ctrl-y 
* __Drag and drop__ : move frames around in your framesheet, using drag and drop

And a screenshot, for the record :

30 Aug 2012
------------------------------------
Many new features in 2 days :
* __save animations__, they are persisted in the cloud, and can be retrieved via a __unique URL__
* __color picker__, no longer limited to black and white 
* __local storage__, your work is automatically backed up locally
* __color palette__, listing all the colors already used in the animation
* __slider__ for choosing the speed of the preview

UI was slightly updated :

28 Aug 2012
------------------------------------
Thanks to grosbouddha, new features added to Piskel :
* modify preview speed !
* remove frames
* transparent background

24 Aug 2012 (aka the thing I did last night)
------------------------------------
* create small animations in __black__ (left click) and __white__ (right click)
* and actually animations are always in __32x32__ zoomed 10 times
* you can __not even save them__ ! 
* add new frames for your animation
* do small __ridiculous__ characters

Looks like this :
