======

The goal is to create an easy-to-use/in-the-cloud/web-based 2d animation editor. 

v0.0whatever (aka the thing I did last night)
------------------------------------
You can :
* create small animations in black (left click) and white (right click)
* and actually animations are always in 32x32 zoomed 10 times
* you can not even save them ! 
* add new frames for your animation
* do small ridiculous characters

Looks like this :

On the left, the list of frames for the animation, in the middle the editable canvas, on the right the LIVE-ANIMATED-PREVIEW (rocket science stuff going on here).
