The goal is to create an easy-to-use/in-the-cloud/web-based 2d animation editor. 

v0.0whatever (aka the thing I did last night)
------------------------------------
You can :
* create small animations in __black__ (left click) and __white__ (right click)
* and actually animations are always in __32x32__ zoomed 10 times
* you can __not even save them__ ! 
* add new frames for your animation
* do small __ridiculous__ characters

Looks like this :

**On the left**, the list of frames for the animation. 
**In the 'middle'**, the editable canvas.
**On the right**, the LIVE-ANIMATED-PREVIEW (rocket science stuff going on here).
