Piskel
======

The goal is to create an easy-to-use/in-the-cloud/web-based 2d animation editor.

v0.0almostthere
------------------------------------
**30 Aug 2012** : Many new features in 2 days :
* __save animations__, they are persisted in the cloud, and can be retrieved via a __unique URL__
* __color picker__, no longer limited to black and white 
* __local storage__, your work is automatically backed up locally
* __color palette__, listing all the colors already used in the animation
* __slider__ for choosing the speed of the preview

UI was slightly updated :

v0.0something
------------------------------------
**28 Aug 2012** : Thanks to grosbouddha, new features added to Piskel :
* modify preview speed !
* remove frames
* transparent background

v0.0whatever (aka the thing I did last night)
------------------------------------
**24 Aug 2012** : You can :
* create small animations in __black__ (left click) and __white__ (right click)
* and actually animations are always in __32x32__ zoomed 10 times
* you can __not even save them__ ! 
* add new frames for your animation
* do small __ridiculous__ characters

Looks like this :
